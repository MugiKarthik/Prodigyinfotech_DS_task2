# Task 2
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

# About the data:
dataset is taken from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
The data has been split into two groups:

training set (train.csv)
test set (test.csv)
The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.

The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

We also include gender_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.

# Conclusion:
Performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, is crucial for understanding the underlying patterns and relationships between variables. Initially, data cleaning involves handling missing values, addressing outliers, and ensuring consistency in data formats. Subsequently, EDA uncovers insights through statistical summaries, visualizations, and correlation analyses. For the Titanic dataset, this process would reveal factors influencing survival rates, like passenger class or gender, and highlight trends such as survival disparities across different demographics. EDA also prepares the dataset for modeling by identifying relevant features and potential preprocessing needs, ensuring subsequent analyses and predictions are grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the data.
